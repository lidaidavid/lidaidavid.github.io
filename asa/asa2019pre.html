# Data and methods

---

# Universe: National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) participants

### A complete dataset from a central province in 2014, it contains all students from this province who took the tests.
### Artistic or athletic majors are excluded because test scores don't decide their results.
### Students with 0 scores are excluded for being irrelevant to this research.
### A total of 56,390 students remain, roughly 90% of all students.
### Limited by the length of this presentation, I will only discuss natural sciences students, 37,599 in total. The results are robust for social sciences students.

# Variables: ethnicity, sex, hukou status; test scores, admissions

### The majority is Han. Hui (a muslim people) makes 27.5% of students. Other mitorities make 0.8% of students.
### 42.6% of all students are female. 59.2% are of rural hukou status.
### Hui students are awarded 20 bonus points, other minorities 10 points. All students from a designated poverty area are awarded an additional 10 points.
### The total score plus bonus points becomes the .red[effective score], which determines admissions. Students with higher effective scores have strict priority over students with lower scores in admission.
### Results: 22.7% admitted into tier 1 universities, 17.3% into tier 2 universities, 13.1% into tier 3 universities, and 30% into vocatioanl schools.

# Defining the dependent variable

.pull-left-60[

### Approach .red[1]: conventionally, the dependent variable is defined as "admitted by college or not". Some studies (eg. Wu 2016) further breaks it down to several levels, yet the granularity is still lacking. 

### Approach .red[2]: Instead of using categories of colleges, I define the dependent variable as "effective score exceeding x". This provides much finer granularity since x can be any interger from 1 to 749.

### If admissions are purely .red[meritocratic], then 1) any student whose effective score exceeds the threshold (lowest effective score of all admitted students) of a given category of college is admitted into that category or above; 2) any student with lower score is not admitted into that category or above.

### If admissions are purely .red[meritocratic], then Approach .red[1] is a subset of Approach .red[2]. Approach .red[2] will be stricly superior because it doesn't lose information while providing finer granularity.

# Hypotheses

### Based on previous discussions, this article tests the following hypothese:

### Hypothesis 1: minority students are disadvantaged academically compared to Han students;

### Hypothesis 2: the bonus point policy affect minorities chances of admission positively;

### Hypothesis 3: admissions are purely meritocratic.

# Methods: logit models in iterations

### The dependent variable is a binary one. Logit models, or logistic regression analysis, is a common tool to analyze binary dependent variables. It is in the family of Generalized Linear Models, on which I find some great notes from [Germán Rodríguez(2007)](https://data.princeton.edu/wws509/notes).

- model 1: 
`$$logit(\pi_{admission}) = \eta + \alpha_1 Hui + \alpha_2 Other Minority$$`

- model 2: 
`$$logit(\pi_{admission}) = \eta + \alpha_1 Hui + \alpha_2 Other Minority + \beta Female + \gamma Rural$$`
- model 3: 
`$$logit(\pi_{admission}) = \eta + \alpha_1 Hui + \alpha_2 Other Minority + \beta Female + \gamma Rural + \alpha_1 \beta Hui*Female +$$`
`$$\alpha_2 \beta Other*Female + \alpha_1 \gamma Hui*Rural + \alpha_2 \gamma Other*Rural$$`

### In Approach 1 admission is defined with tier 1, 2, 3 and vocational schools. In Approach 2 admission is defined from 1 to 749 for each model. The results are compared to test Hypothsis 3.

# Conclusions

### Hypothesis 3 is largely accruate for students above tier 2 threshold. It's reasonable to substitute actual admissions by "effective score exceeding x" if x is greater than tier 2 threshold. Following discussions are restricted to students above tier 2 threshold.
### Hypothesis 1 is not true. 
- Inequality is different depending on which point is defined as the selection threshold.
- Hui are disadvantaged academically for all thresholds above tier 2. Other minorities are advantaged academically for most thresholds.

### Hypothesis 2 is true yet too simplistic.
- All minorities are advantaged in admissions above tier 2 due to bonus point policy. Non-Hui minorities didn't need the policy to begin with.
- The effects of the policy are different for students at different stratum. High achieving minorities may benefit the most from this policy, while supposedly they suffer the least from being a minority.

### In conclusion, inequality is threhold-dependent and stratified, and uniform policies can lead to unintended, non-uniform consequences.

# Reflections

### In Figure 2, ethnic inequalities are not significant at tier 2 threshold. Yet in Table 2 minorites are advantaged being admitted into tier 2 or above. This is due to preferential admission to specialized programs or univerisities such as Minzu University of China. In my forthcoming work I have discussed this issue further. 

### This data is not nationally representative. However, I would argure automatically dismissing this research is wrong. In Li (2019) I have illustrated that in China, most survey data are either incapable of shedding light on educatioanl inequailty with finer granularity, or .red[biased]. On the other hand, since college admissions are executed centrally on a provincial level, and this is the complete data on the admissions, at least it provides reliable insights and facts about one province in one year. 

### Further more, the analytical procedures of this research is easily replicated if scholars have access to other admissions datasets. These datasets are administrative data from the Municipal Educational Examinations Authority(教育考试院) in each provinces. Scholars can contribute to the ongoing controversy of affirmative policies if the data can be shared on a wider scale.
